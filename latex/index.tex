The original idea to use this library in combination with the lectures {\bfseries Applied Software Engineering}, {\bfseries Interaction and Game Programming}, and {\bfseries Game Architecture} from the Media Engineering and Design (Bachelor\textquotesingle{}s program) and Interactive Media (Master\textquotesingle{}s program) at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. The library has been extended with more and more functions so that it is now a valuable collection of tools for mathematics, computer graphics, digital audio processing, and last but not least for computer game development. All in a manageable and limited scope and purpose, but still quite useful.

All this has been developed to produce didactically illustrative source code. Therefore, one or the other design decision has been made in favor of readability, while performance has not been completely ignored.\hypertarget{index_ack_section}{}\section{Acknowledgement}\label{index_ack_section}
I want to extend a big thank you to Nora Loimayr for her significant help in many design decisions. She is the instructor of the exercises in the {\bfseries Applied Software Engineering} course. Therefore she not only has to use this library but also explains it to others.

I would also like to thank my students, who are ultimately the target audience, the beta testers, and the library users.\hypertarget{index_hist_sect}{}\section{Version History}\label{index_hist_sect}
This library is continuously updated and extended. The version history gives an overview of the changes this library has gone through, including the latest updates. The version history can be found on this page \hyperlink{CHANGES}{Version History}.\hypertarget{index_io_sect}{}\section{Modules}\label{index_io_sect}
